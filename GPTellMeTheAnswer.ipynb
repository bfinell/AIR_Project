            "Skipping irregular line: Unary numeral system ||| The unary numeral system is the bijective base-1 numeral system. It is the simplest numeral system to represent natural numbers: in order to represent a number N, an arbitrarily chosen symbol representing 1 is repeated N times. For examples, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... would be represented in this system as 1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, ... These numbers should be distinguished from repunits, which are also written as sequences of ones but have their usual decimal numerical interpretation. This system is used in tallying. For example, using the tally mark |, the number 3 is represented as |||. In East Asian cultures, the number three is represented as “三”, a character that is drawn with three strokes.\n",

            "Skipping irregular line: Tiny and miny ||| In mathematics, tiny and miny are operators that yield infinitesimal values when applied to numbers in combinatorial game theory. Given a positive number G, tiny G (denoted by ⧾G in many texts) is equal to {0||0|-G} for any game G, whereas miny G (analogously denoted ⧿G) is tiny G’s negative, or {G|0||0}. Tiny and miny aren’t just abstract mathematical operators on combinatorial games: tiny and miny games do occur “naturally” in such games as toppling dominoes. Specifically, tiny n, where n is a natural number, can be generated by placing two black dominoes outside n + 2 white dominoes. Tiny games and up have certain curious relational characteristics. Specifically, though ⧾G is infinitesimal with respect to ↑ for all positive values of x, ⧾⧾⧾G is equal to up. Expansion of ⧾⧾⧾G into its canonical form yields {0||||||0|||||0||0|-G|||0||||0}. While the expression appears daunting, some careful and persistent expansion of the game tree of ⧾⧾⧾G + ↓ will show that it is a second player win, and that, consequently, ⧾⧾⧾G = ↑. Similarly curious, Conway noted, calling it “amusing,” that “↑ is the unique solution of ⧾G = G.” Conway’s assertion is also easily verifiable with canonical forms and game trees.\n",

            "Skipping irregular line: Countermeasure (computer) ||| In computer security a countermeasure is an action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a threat, a vulnerability, or an attack by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the harm it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken. The definition is as IETF RFC 2828 that is the same as CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010 by Committee on National Security Systems of United States of America. According to the Glossary by InfosecToday, the meaning of countermeasure is: The deployment of a set of security services to protect against a security threat. A synonym is security control. In telecommunications, communication countermeasures are defined as security services as part of OSI Reference model by ITU-T X.800 Recommendation. X.800 and ISO ISO 7498-2 (Information processing systems – Open systems interconnection – Basic Reference Model – Part 2: Security architecture are technically aligned.

The result can potentially compromises the confidentiality, integrity or availability properties of resources (potentially different that the vulnerable one) of the organization and others involved parties (customers, suppliers). The so-called CIA triad is the basis of information security. The attack can be active when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A \"passive attack\" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources: so it compromises confidentiality. A threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger that might exploit a vulnerability. A threat can be either \"intentional\" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or \"accidental\" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an \"act of God\" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado). A set of policies concerned with information security management, the information security management systems (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to risk management principles, the countermeasures in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country. \n",

Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) needs high pressure and some of the reject stream can be reused by using this device. According to Calder AG, 97% of the energy in the reject stream is recovered. The DWEER system uses a piston doublechamber reciprocating hydraulically driven pump, and a patented valve system in a high pressure batch process with large pressure vessels, similar to a locomotive, to capture and transfer the energy lost in the membrane reject stream. Its advantage is its high efficiency rate, but it suffers from complex and large mechanical components which are susceptible to corrosion from seawater due to its metal composition.\n",

            "Roswell George Mills (1896 - 1966) was a Canadian journalist, poet and magazine publisher. A friend and colleague of poet Elsa Gidlow, he is the first known gay man in Canadian history whose life and sexual orientation is attested through biographical literature rather than court records of a sodomy trial. Born in Buffalo, New York, on July 4, 1896, Mills moved to Montreal, Quebec, in childhood with his family. In early adulthood Mills worked as a journalist for the Montreal Star, where his byline appeared on the financial pages and as a theatre and opera critic. He also wrote a women's column under the pseudonym \"Jessie Roberts\". He and Gidlow met at a poetry club. According to Gidlow,  He was beautiful. About nineteen, exquisitely made up, slightly perfumed, dressed in ordinary men's clothing but a little on the chi-chi side. And he swayed about, you know. We became friends almost instantly because we were both interested in poetry and the arts.  Mills was open about his sexuality and considered it a personal crusade to make people \"understand that it was beautiful, not evil, to love others of one's own sex and make love with them.\" Between 1918 and 1920 Mills and Gidlow collaborated on the underground magazine Les Mouches Fantastiques, Canada's first known LGBT publication. Mills published several poems in the magazine. An Episcopalian priest from South Dakota, Graeme Davis, took leave from his church posting and moved to Montreal to become Mills' lover after discovering the magazine. Mills also gave piano lessons. Mills followed Gidlow in the early 1920s to New York City, where he took a job in the financial section of the Oil, Paint, and Drug Reporter. He soon ended his relationship with Davis and moved in with Khagendrenath Ghose, an immigrant from India. He subsequently lost contact with Gidlow for a number of years, although they met again in Paris in 1928, where Mills was living with a German architecture student named Jurgen. Mills, Gidlow and Jurgen all travelled to Berlin in 1929, discovering the city's burgeoning gay subculture and touring Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute for Sex Research. Gidlow later moved back to the United States while Mills remained in Europe, although the two continued to correspond. By 1943, Mills was again living in New York City and working for The Brooklyn Eagle. By 1961 he was living in Miami, Florida, where he died on May 5, 1966.\n",

            "Danish cuisine (Danish: det danske køkken), originating from the peasant population's own local produce, was enhanced by cooking techniques developed in the late 19th century and the wider availability of goods after the Industrial Revolution. The open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød, which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals are traditionally prepared from ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls) and medisterpølse, or from more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) or kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Denmark is known for its Carlsberg and Tuborg beers and for its akvavit and bitters, but amongst the Danes themselves imported wine has gained in popularity since the 1960s. Cooking in Denmark has always been inspired by foreign and continental practises and the use of imported tropical spices like cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and black pepper can be traced to the Danish cuisine of the Middle Ages and some even to the Vikings. In recent years, some Danish chefs have developed the new Danish cuisine, an innovative way of cooking based on high-quality local produce. This new philosophy and cuisine has attracted the attention of and been celebrated by the international gourmet community and contributed to the considerable number of highly acclaimed restaurants in Copenhagen and the province, with some of them awarded Michelin stars.\n",

            "A distributed element filter is an electronic filter in which capacitance, inductance and resistance (the elements of the circuit) are not localised in discrete capacitors, inductors and resistors as they are in conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass, but to block others. Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors, and the circuits so built are described by the lumped element model, which considers each element to be \"lumped together\" at one place. That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases, or equivalently as the wavelength decreases. The distributed element model applies at all frequencies, and is used in transmission line theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and are inextricably mixed together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate \"lumped\" capacitors and inductors. There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the microwave band (wavelength less than one metre). Distributed element filters are used in many of the same applications as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach. There are many component forms used to construct distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a discontinuity on the transmission line. These discontinuities present a reactive impedance to a wavefront travelling down the line, and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped inductors, capacitors or resonators, as required by the filter. The development of distributed element filters was spurred on by the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World War II. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology can be found in several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes.\n",

            "In English-speaking culture, a milkman joke is a class of joke exploiting fear of adultery and mistaken paternity. This class of jokes has its roots in the early part of the 20th century, prior to the regular availability of milk in supermarkets. At that time, milk in glass bottles was delivered directly to customers' houses by milkmen, generally in the morning (at which time empty bottles were also collected). Men were commonly the main financial supporters of their families, and a man's wife tended to remain at home to care for their children and home. As the milkman would visit the home at a time when the husband would be away at work, this created an opportune situation for adultery. Similar jokes referring to other professions, such as postmen, plumbers, pizza delivery drivers, and swimming pool cleaners, are also known. Oftentimes, a different profession will replace the milkman in various jokes. For instance, in Spain, 'milkman' jokes are told about butaneros: persons who deliver butane, bottled fuel gas.\n",

Coleman-Norton (Dowbiggin, 2008, p. 36), with the purpose \"to aid in the preparation, promotion, enactment and enforcement of legislative measures designed to provide for the improvement of the human stock by the selective sterilization of the mentally defective and of those afflicted with inherited or inheritable physical disease.” Encouraged by the eugenic sterilization legislation enacted by the state of Georgia in 1937, the SLNJ lobbied intensely, although unsuccessfully, between 1939 and 1942 for the passage of a state sterilization law in New Jersey and conducted an educational program of publications and exhibits designed to promote sterilization. In 1943, the League was renamed Sterilization League For Human Betterment and began to expand its activities nationwide. After objections from relatives of Ezra Gosney, founder of the Human Betterment Foundation, the organization formally incorporated and changed its name again to Birthright, Inc.: a national, nonprofit, educational organization with the aim of promoting \"all reliable and scientific means for improving the biological stock of the human race.” When the Human Betterment Foundation was dissolved in 1943, its promotional activities for eugenic sterilization were continued through Birthright, which received most of the Foundation's records regarding its work on sterilization programs and also the (financial) support of such past Foundation-backers as C.M. Goethe, Paul Popenoe, and Lois Gosney Castle, who had succeeded her father in 1942 as head of the Foundation. The Manhattan studio at the New York Academy of Medicine of Robert Latou Dickinson, who had been a member since 1943 and became the first chairman of the organization's medical and scientific committee in 1949, served as new headquarters in 1950. That same year, Birthright was renamed the Human Betterment Association of America (HBAA).\n",

It has distinctive wings with characteristic black blotches at their proximal ends, which make the dragonfly look as though it is wearing saddlebags. The black saddlebags is a relatively large dragonfly at about 5 centimeters in length. The body is thin and black, and the female may have lighter spotting or mottling dorsally. The head is much wider than the rest of the body and is dark brown in color. The insect can be found in at bodies of stagnant water, such as ponds and ditches. The female mates once and stores all the sperm she needs for fertilization. If she should mate again, the second male will remove the sperm of the first male from her body with the brush-like apparatus on his specially-adapted penis. The larvae of the dragonflies hatch and eat anything they can catch, favoring a carnivorous diet of organisms smaller than themselves. Adults of the species, especially males, congregate in swarms. Some populations of this dragonfly undertake migrations. Both the larvae and adult forms are efficient predators of mosquitoes, so they are a helpful insect to have in wet areas where mosquito infestations occur.\n",

            "original summary: The Dual Work Exchanger Energy Recovery (DWEER) is an energy recovery device. In the 1990s developed by DWEER Bermuda and licensed by Calder AG for use in the Caribbean. Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) needs high pressure and some of the reject stream can be reused by using this device. According to Calder AG, 97% of the energy in the reject stream is recovered. The DWEER system uses a piston doublechamber reciprocating hydraulically driven pump, and a patented valve system in a high pressure batch process with large pressure vessels, similar to a locomotive, to capture and transfer the energy lost in the membrane reject stream. Its advantage is its high efficiency rate, but it suffers from complex and large mechanical components which are susceptible to corrosion from seawater due to its metal composition. \n",

            "original summary: Roswell George Mills (1896 - 1966) was a Canadian journalist, poet and magazine publisher. A friend and colleague of poet Elsa Gidlow, he is the first known gay man in Canadian history whose life and sexual orientation is attested through biographical literature rather than court records of a sodomy trial. Born in Buffalo, New York, on July 4, 1896, Mills moved to Montreal, Quebec, in childhood with his family. In early adulthood Mills worked as a journalist for the Montreal Star, where his byline appeared on the financial pages and as a theatre and opera critic. He also wrote a women's column under the pseudonym \"Jessie Roberts\". He and Gidlow met at a poetry club. According to Gidlow,  He was beautiful. About nineteen, exquisitely made up, slightly perfumed, dressed in ordinary men's clothing but a little on the chi-chi side. And he swayed about, you know. We became friends almost instantly because we were both interested in poetry and the arts.  Mills was open about his sexuality and considered it a personal crusade to make people \"understand that it was beautiful, not evil, to love others of one's own sex and make love with them.\" Between 1918 and 1920 Mills and Gidlow collaborated on the underground magazine Les Mouches Fantastiques, Canada's first known LGBT publication. Mills published several poems in the magazine. An Episcopalian priest from South Dakota, Graeme Davis, took leave from his church posting and moved to Montreal to become Mills' lover after discovering the magazine. Mills also gave piano lessons. Mills followed Gidlow in the early 1920s to New York City, where he took a job in the financial section of the Oil, Paint, and Drug Reporter. He soon ended his relationship with Davis and moved in with Khagendrenath Ghose, an immigrant from India. He subsequently lost contact with Gidlow for a number of years, although they met again in Paris in 1928, where Mills was living with a German architecture student named Jurgen. Mills, Gidlow and Jurgen all travelled to Berlin in 1929, discovering the city's burgeoning gay subculture and touring Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute for Sex Research. Gidlow later moved back to the United States while Mills remained in Europe, although the two continued to correspond. By 1943, Mills was again living in New York City and working for The Brooklyn Eagle. By 1961 he was living in Miami, Florida, where he died on May 5, 1966. \n",

            "original summary: Danish cuisine (Danish: det danske køkken), originating from the peasant population's own local produce, was enhanced by cooking techniques developed in the late 19th century and the wider availability of goods after the Industrial Revolution. The open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød, which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals are traditionally prepared from ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls) and medisterpølse, or from more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) or kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Denmark is known for its Carlsberg and Tuborg beers and for its akvavit and bitters, but amongst the Danes themselves imported wine has gained in popularity since the 1960s. Cooking in Denmark has always been inspired by foreign and continental practises and the use of imported tropical spices like cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and black pepper can be traced to the Danish cuisine of the Middle Ages and some even to the Vikings. In recent years, some Danish chefs have developed the new Danish cuisine, an innovative way of cooking based on high-quality local produce. This new philosophy and cuisine has attracted the attention of and been celebrated by the international gourmet community and contributed to the considerable number of highly acclaimed restaurants in Copenhagen and the province, with some of them awarded Michelin stars. \n",

The highway runs from Pleasant Street in the neighbourhood of Woodside in the south to the A. Murray MacKay Bridge in the north. It serves as a key transportation link for Dartmouth and the Halifax Regional Municipality. The section from Highway 118 (Woodland Avenue) to the MacKay Bridge was constructed at the same time as the bridge, opening in 1970.

            "original summary: The GTA Faith Alliance is otherwise known as the Greater Toronto Area Faith Allaince. The alliance was founded in February 2003 as a joint effort of about 40 religious leaders focussing on the issue of youth violence, particularly involving gangs and guns. The Alliance has formed its activities on the work of Reverend Eugene Rivers of Boston who has utilized a corps of pastors. These pastors have worked to create alternatives to street gangs for disadvantaged Black youths. The Alliance brought Rivers to Toronto in early 2006 to meet with police and community leaders in an attempt to replicate the \"Boston Miracle\" in Toronto. As a result, the Alliance launched a program to recruit 400 mentors who would lead 70 youth oriented after-school programs in churches across the city in an attempt to divert at-risk youth from gangs and crime. \n",

            "original summary: A distributed element filter is an electronic filter in which capacitance, inductance and resistance (the elements of the circuit) are not localised in discrete capacitors, inductors and resistors as they are in conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass, but to block others. Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors, and the circuits so built are described by the lumped element model, which considers each element to be \"lumped together\" at one place. That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases, or equivalently as the wavelength decreases. The distributed element model applies at all frequencies, and is used in transmission line theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and are inextricably mixed together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate \"lumped\" capacitors and inductors. There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the microwave band (wavelength less than one metre). Distributed element filters are used in many of the same applications as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach. There are many component forms used to construct distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a discontinuity on the transmission line. These discontinuities present a reactive impedance to a wavefront travelling down the line, and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped inductors, capacitors or resonators, as required by the filter. The development of distributed element filters was spurred on by the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World War II. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology can be found in several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes. \n",

            "original summary: In English-speaking culture, a milkman joke is a class of joke exploiting fear of adultery and mistaken paternity. This class of jokes has its roots in the early part of the 20th century, prior to the regular availability of milk in supermarkets. At that time, milk in glass bottles was delivered directly to customers' houses by milkmen, generally in the morning (at which time empty bottles were also collected). Men were commonly the main financial supporters of their families, and a man's wife tended to remain at home to care for their children and home. As the milkman would visit the home at a time when the husband would be away at work, this created an opportune situation for adultery. Similar jokes referring to other professions, such as postmen, plumbers, pizza delivery drivers, and swimming pool cleaners, are also known. Oftentimes, a different profession will replace the milkman in various jokes. For instance, in Spain, 'milkman' jokes are told about butaneros: persons who deliver butane, bottled fuel gas. \n",

            "original summary: The Sterilization League of New Jersey (SLNJ) organization was founded in 1937 by Marion Stephenson Olden (1888–1989), a eugenics-minded social worker and wife of Princeton professor Paul R. Coleman-Norton (Dowbiggin, 2008, p. 36), with the purpose \"to aid in the preparation, promotion, enactment and enforcement of legislative measures designed to provide for the improvement of the human stock by the selective sterilization of the mentally defective and of those afflicted with inherited or inheritable physical disease.” Encouraged by the eugenic sterilization legislation enacted by the state of Georgia in 1937, the SLNJ lobbied intensely, although unsuccessfully, between 1939 and 1942 for the passage of a state sterilization law in New Jersey and conducted an educational program of publications and exhibits designed to promote sterilization. In 1943, the League was renamed Sterilization League For Human Betterment and began to expand its activities nationwide. After objections from relatives of Ezra Gosney, founder of the Human Betterment Foundation, the organization formally incorporated and changed its name again to Birthright, Inc.: a national, nonprofit, educational organization with the aim of promoting \"all reliable and scientific means for improving the biological stock of the human race.” When the Human Betterment Foundation was dissolved in 1943, its promotional activities for eugenic sterilization were continued through Birthright, which received most of the Foundation's records regarding its work on sterilization programs and also the (financial) support of such past Foundation-backers as C.M. Goethe, Paul Popenoe, and Lois Gosney Castle, who had succeeded her father in 1942 as head of the Foundation. The Manhattan studio at the New York Academy of Medicine of Robert Latou Dickinson, who had been a member since 1943 and became the first chairman of the organization's medical and scientific committee in 1949, served as new headquarters in 1950. That same year, Birthright was renamed the Human Betterment Association of America (HBAA). \n",

            "original summary: The black saddlebags (Tramea lacerata) is a species of skimmer dragonfly found throughout North America. It has distinctive wings with characteristic black blotches at their proximal ends, which make the dragonfly look as though it is wearing saddlebags. The black saddlebags is a relatively large dragonfly at about 5 centimeters in length. The body is thin and black, and the female may have lighter spotting or mottling dorsally. The head is much wider than the rest of the body and is dark brown in color. The insect can be found in at bodies of stagnant water, such as ponds and ditches. The female mates once and stores all the sperm she needs for fertilization. If she should mate again, the second male will remove the sperm of the first male from her body with the brush-like apparatus on his specially-adapted penis. The larvae of the dragonflies hatch and eat anything they can catch, favoring a carnivorous diet of organisms smaller than themselves. Adults of the species, especially males, congregate in swarms. Some populations of this dragonfly undertake migrations. Both the larvae and adult forms are efficient predators of mosquitoes, so they are a helpful insect to have in wet areas where mosquito infestations occur. \n",

            "Roswell George Mills (1896 - 1966) was a Canadian journalist, poet and magazine publisher. A friend and colleague of poet Elsa Gidlow, he is the first known gay man in Canadian history whose life and sexual orientation is attested through biographical literature rather than court records of a sodomy trial. Born in Buffalo, New York, on July 4, 1896, Mills moved to Montreal, Quebec, in childhood with his family. In early adulthood Mills worked as a journalist for the Montreal Star, where his byline appeared on the financial pages and as a theatre and opera critic. He also wrote a women's column under the pseudonym \"Jessie Roberts\". He and Gidlow met at a poetry club. According to Gidlow,  He was beautiful. About nineteen, exquisitely made up, slightly perfumed, dressed in ordinary men's clothing but a little on the chi-chi side. And he swayed about, you know. We became friends almost instantly because we were both interested in poetry and the arts.  Mills was open about his sexuality and considered it a personal crusade to make people \"understand that it was beautiful, not evil, to love others of one's own sex and make love with them.\" Between 1918 and 1920 Mills and Gidlow collaborated on the underground magazine Les Mouches Fantastiques, Canada's first known LGBT publication. Mills published several poems in the magazine. An Episcopalian priest from South Dakota, Graeme Davis, took leave from his church posting and moved to Montreal to become Mills' lover after discovering the magazine. Mills also gave piano lessons. Mills followed Gidlow in the early 1920s to New York City, where he took a job in the financial section of the Oil, Paint, and Drug Reporter. He soon ended his relationship with Davis and moved in with Khagendrenath Ghose, an immigrant from India. He subsequently lost contact with Gidlow for a number of years, although they met again in Paris in 1928, where Mills was living with a German architecture student named Jurgen. Mills, Gidlow and Jurgen all travelled to Berlin in 1929, discovering the city's burgeoning gay subculture and touring Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute for Sex Research. Gidlow later moved back to the United States while Mills remained in Europe, although the two continued to correspond. By 1943, Mills was again living in New York City and working for The Brooklyn Eagle. By 1961 he was living in Miami, Florida, where he died on May 5, 1966.\n",

            "Danish cuisine (Danish: det danske køkken), originating from the peasant population's own local produce, was enhanced by cooking techniques developed in the late 19th century and the wider availability of goods after the Industrial Revolution. The open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød, which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals are traditionally prepared from ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls) and medisterpølse, or from more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) or kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Denmark is known for its Carlsberg and Tuborg beers and for its akvavit and bitters, but amongst the Danes themselves imported wine has gained in popularity since the 1960s. Cooking in Denmark has always been inspired by foreign and continental practises and the use of imported tropical spices like cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and black pepper can be traced to the Danish cuisine of the Middle Ages and some even to the Vikings. In recent years, some Danish chefs have developed the new Danish cuisine, an innovative way of cooking based on high-quality local produce. This new philosophy and cuisine has attracted the attention of and been celebrated by the international gourmet community and contributed to the considerable number of highly acclaimed restaurants in Copenhagen and the province, with some of them awarded Michelin stars.\n",

            "A distributed element filter is an electronic filter in which capacitance, inductance and resistance (the elements of the circuit) are not localised in discrete capacitors, inductors and resistors as they are in conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass, but to block others. Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors, and the circuits so built are described by the lumped element model, which considers each element to be \"lumped together\" at one place. That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases, or equivalently as the wavelength decreases. The distributed element model applies at all frequencies, and is used in transmission line theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and are inextricably mixed together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate \"lumped\" capacitors and inductors. There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the microwave band (wavelength less than one metre). Distributed element filters are used in many of the same applications as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach. There are many component forms used to construct distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a discontinuity on the transmission line. These discontinuities present a reactive impedance to a wavefront travelling down the line, and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped inductors, capacitors or resonators, as required by the filter. The development of distributed element filters was spurred on by the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World War II. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology can be found in several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes.\n",

This class of jokes has its roots in the early part of the 20th century, prior to the regular availability of milk in supermarkets. At that time, milk in glass bottles was delivered directly to customers' houses by milkmen, generally in the morning (at which time empty bottles were also collected). Men were commonly the main financial supporters of their families, and a man's wife tended to remain at home to care for their children and home. As the milkman would visit the home at a time when the husband would be away at work, this created an opportune situation for adultery. Similar jokes referring to other professions, such as postmen, plumbers, pizza delivery drivers, and swimming pool cleaners, are also known. Oftentimes, a different profession will replace the milkman in various jokes. For instance, in Spain, 'milkman' jokes are told about butaneros: persons who deliver butane, bottled fuel gas.\n",

            "The Sterilization League of New Jersey (SLNJ) organization was founded in 1937 by Marion Stephenson Olden (1888–1989), a eugenics-minded social worker and wife of Princeton professor Paul R. Coleman-Norton (Dowbiggin, 2008, p. 36), with the purpose \"to aid in the preparation, promotion, enactment and enforcement of legislative measures designed to provide for the improvement of the human stock by the selective sterilization of the mentally defective and of those afflicted with inherited or inheritable physical disease.” Encouraged by the eugenic sterilization legislation enacted by the state of Georgia in 1937, the SLNJ lobbied intensely, although unsuccessfully, between 1939 and 1942 for the passage of a state sterilization law in New Jersey and conducted an educational program of publications and exhibits designed to promote sterilization. In 1943, the League was renamed Sterilization League For Human Betterment and began to expand its activities nationwide. After objections from relatives of Ezra Gosney, founder of the Human Betterment Foundation, the organization formally incorporated and changed its name again to Birthright, Inc.: a national, nonprofit, educational organization with the aim of promoting \"all reliable and scientific means for improving the biological stock of the human race.” When the Human Betterment Foundation was dissolved in 1943, its promotional activities for eugenic sterilization were continued through Birthright, which received most of the Foundation's records regarding its work on sterilization programs and also the (financial) support of such past Foundation-backers as C.M. Goethe, Paul Popenoe, and Lois Gosney Castle, who had succeeded her father in 1942 as head of the Foundation. The Manhattan studio at the New York Academy of Medicine of Robert Latou Dickinson, who had been a member since 1943 and became the first chairman of the organization's medical and scientific committee in 1949, served as new headquarters in 1950. That same year, Birthright was renamed the Human Betterment Association of America (HBAA).\n",

            "The black saddlebags (Tramea lacerata) is a species of skimmer dragonfly found throughout North America. It has distinctive wings with characteristic black blotches at their proximal ends, which make the dragonfly look as though it is wearing saddlebags. The black saddlebags is a relatively large dragonfly at about 5 centimeters in length. The body is thin and black, and the female may have lighter spotting or mottling dorsally. The head is much wider than the rest of the body and is dark brown in color. The insect can be found in at bodies of stagnant water, such as ponds and ditches. The female mates once and stores all the sperm she needs for fertilization. If she should mate again, the second male will remove the sperm of the first male from her body with the brush-like apparatus on his specially-adapted penis. The larvae of the dragonflies hatch and eat anything they can catch, favoring a carnivorous diet of organisms smaller than themselves. Adults of the species, especially males, congregate in swarms. Some populations of this dragonfly undertake migrations. Both the larvae and adult forms are efficient predators of mosquitoes, so they are a helpful insect to have in wet areas where mosquito infestations occur.\n",

In the 1990s developed by DWEER Bermuda and licensed by Calder AG for use in the Caribbean. Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) needs high pressure and some of the reject stream can be reused by using this device. According to Calder AG, 97% of the energy in the reject stream is recovered. The DWEER system uses a piston doublechamber reciprocating hydraulically driven pump, and a patented valve system in a high pressure batch process with large pressure vessels, similar to a locomotive, to capture and transfer the energy lost in the membrane reject stream. Its advantage is its high efficiency rate, but it suffers from complex and large mechanical components which are susceptible to corrosion from seawater due to its metal composition. \n",

The inlet stream is passed through a heat exchanger, where the waste heat is recovered and transferred to the outlet stream. The outlet stream, which is at a lower pressure and temperature than the inlet stream, is then sent through a second heat exchanger, where the waste heat is recovered and transferred to the inlet stream. This process is known as \"dual work\" because the same amount of work is being done on the steam twice, once on the inlet and once on the outlet stream. DWEER has been used in various power plants around the world, including coal, gas, and combined cycle power plants, and has been shown to increase overall power plant efficiency by up to 10%.\n",

            "original summary: Roswell George Mills (1896 - 1966) was a Canadian journalist, poet and magazine publisher. A friend and colleague of poet Elsa Gidlow, he is the first known gay man in Canadian history whose life and sexual orientation is attested through biographical literature rather than court records of a sodomy trial. Born in Buffalo, New York, on July 4, 1896, Mills moved to Montreal, Quebec, in childhood with his family. In early adulthood Mills worked as a journalist for the Montreal Star, where his byline appeared on the financial pages and as a theatre and opera critic. He also wrote a women's column under the pseudonym \"Jessie Roberts\". He and Gidlow met at a poetry club. According to Gidlow,  He was beautiful. About nineteen, exquisitely made up, slightly perfumed, dressed in ordinary men's clothing but a little on the chi-chi side. And he swayed about, you know. We became friends almost instantly because we were both interested in poetry and the arts.  Mills was open about his sexuality and considered it a personal crusade to make people \"understand that it was beautiful, not evil, to love others of one's own sex and make love with them.\" Between 1918 and 1920 Mills and Gidlow collaborated on the underground magazine Les Mouches Fantastiques, Canada's first known LGBT publication. Mills published several poems in the magazine. An Episcopalian priest from South Dakota, Graeme Davis, took leave from his church posting and moved to Montreal to become Mills' lover after discovering the magazine. Mills also gave piano lessons. Mills followed Gidlow in the early 1920s to New York City, where he took a job in the financial section of the Oil, Paint, and Drug Reporter. He soon ended his relationship with Davis and moved in with Khagendrenath Ghose, an immigrant from India. He subsequently lost contact with Gidlow for a number of years, although they met again in Paris in 1928, where Mills was living with a German architecture student named Jurgen. Mills, Gidlow and Jurgen all travelled to Berlin in 1929, discovering the city's burgeoning gay subculture and touring Magnus Hirschfeld's Institute for Sex Research. Gidlow later moved back to the United States while Mills remained in Europe, although the two continued to correspond. By 1943, Mills was again living in New York City and working for The Brooklyn Eagle. By 1961 he was living in Miami, Florida, where he died on May 5, 1966. \n",

            "original summary: Danish cuisine (Danish: det danske køkken), originating from the peasant population's own local produce, was enhanced by cooking techniques developed in the late 19th century and the wider availability of goods after the Industrial Revolution. The open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød, which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals are traditionally prepared from ground meats, such as frikadeller (meat balls) and medisterpølse, or from more substantial meat and fish dishes such as flæskesteg (roast pork with crackling) or kogt torsk (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Denmark is known for its Carlsberg and Tuborg beers and for its akvavit and bitters, but amongst the Danes themselves imported wine has gained in popularity since the 1960s. Cooking in Denmark has always been inspired by foreign and continental practises and the use of imported tropical spices like cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and black pepper can be traced to the Danish cuisine of the Middle Ages and some even to the Vikings. In recent years, some Danish chefs have developed the new Danish cuisine, an innovative way of cooking based on high-quality local produce. This new philosophy and cuisine has attracted the attention of and been celebrated by the international gourmet community and contributed to the considerable number of highly acclaimed restaurants in Copenhagen and the province, with some of them awarded Michelin stars. \n",

After the war, the castle was taken over by the Soviet military and later served as a military training center. In 1957, the castle was transferred to the state of Thuringia and became a museum, open to the public. The castle is known for its Baroque architecture, and has a rich history, including being the site of the signing of the Barber's Convention, a treaty between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic in 1955. Sayn-Wittgenstein-Karlsburg is a popular tourist destination and is considered one of the most important cultural monuments in the region.

The village has a population of around 300 people, primarily of Kurdish ethnicity. Ağtala has a history of religious persecution, with the village's residents being forced to flee during the Armenian Genocide of 1915. The village was also the site of a 1995 attack by the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) during which several civilians were killed. Today, Ağtala is a primarily agricultural community, with farming being the primary source of income for the village's residents. The village has limited access to education and healthcare, with the nearest hospital and school being located several kilometers away. The village's main source of income is from the hydroelectric power generated by the streams, which is sold to the Turkish government. The village also has a small number of tourists who come to visit the natural beauty of the area. In recent years, the Turkish government has invested in the village's infrastructure\n",

The Alliance has formed its activities on the work of Reverend Eugene Rivers of Boston who has utilized a corps of pastors. These pastors have worked to create alternatives to street gangs for disadvantaged Black youths. The Alliance brought Rivers to Toronto in early 2006 to meet with police and community leaders in an attempt to replicate the \"Boston Miracle\" in Toronto. As a result, the Alliance launched a program to recruit 400 mentors who would lead 70 youth oriented after-school programs in churches across the city in an attempt to divert at-risk youth from gangs and crime. \n",

It was the home of John B. Kelly who had an early book binding and printing firm. It is one of only two known examples of its architectural type in Utah; the other, the Alma Staker House in Mount Pleasant, Utah is also NRHP-listed. It is a \"temple-form\" Greek Revival home that follows a pattern promoted by Minard Lafever. Although it is of modest size, the symmetric front design, with two story center and side wings, is imitative of monumental ancient Greek forms. \n",

The model is named after the German physicist and mathematician Gustav Ludwig (Gustav-Ludwig) Knittel, who was also known as Lübbert. The Lübbert model is a solution to the Einstein field equations, which describe the gravity of the universe, and it is a type of Friedmann-Lemaître model, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations that describe the expansion of the universe. The Lübbert model is a closed universe, which means that it has a finite size and will eventually collapse in a \"big crunch\" in the future. It is one of the first cosmological models that included the concept of a \"big crunch\" and is considered one of the earliest examples of an open-universe model. The Lübbert model is named after Gustav-Ludwig Knittel, who was a colleague of Einstein and de Sitter and who suggested that they consider the case of a closed universe, which is the case of the Lübbert model.

            "original summary: A distributed element filter is an electronic filter in which capacitance, inductance and resistance (the elements of the circuit) are not localised in discrete capacitors, inductors and resistors as they are in conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass, but to block others. Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors, and the circuits so built are described by the lumped element model, which considers each element to be \"lumped together\" at one place. That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases, or equivalently as the wavelength decreases. The distributed element model applies at all frequencies, and is used in transmission line theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and are inextricably mixed together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate \"lumped\" capacitors and inductors. There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the microwave band (wavelength less than one metre). Distributed element filters are used in many of the same applications as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach. There are many component forms used to construct distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a discontinuity on the transmission line. These discontinuities present a reactive impedance to a wavefront travelling down the line, and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped inductors, capacitors or resonators, as required by the filter. The development of distributed element filters was spurred on by the military need for radar and electronic counter measures during World War II. Lumped element analogue filters had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the microwave links used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology can be found in several mass-produced consumer items, such as the converters (figure 1 shows an example) used with satellite television dishes. \n",

            "\tgenerated summary:  Distributed element filters (DEF) are a type of electronic filter that uses multiple elements, or stages, to perform the same filtering function as a single-stage filter. This approach to filtering has several advantages over traditional single-stage filters, such as increased filtering accuracy, improved stability, and reduced weight and size. In a distributed element filter, each element consists of an inductor, a capacitor, and a switch. The switch is used to add or remove the element from the filter, which is known as \"shunting\" the element. Shunting the element changes the impedance of the filter, which in turn affects the frequency response of the filter. The impedance of the filter is a function of the ratio of the inductor to the capacitor, as well as the impedance of the load. The impedance of the load is usually represented by the resistance of a resistor, which is connected in parallel with the filter. The impedance of the load is an important parameter in the design of distributed element filters, as it determines the stability and frequency response of the filter. The stability of a distributed element filter is determined by the stability of the load impedance, which is a function of the ratio of the inductor to the capacitor. The stability of the load impedance is a critical factor in the design of distributed element filters, as it determines the stability of the filter and the frequency response of\n",

It was one of the first schools in the United States to be established specifically for students with disabilities. The school was intended to provide a comprehensive education for students with a variety of physical, mental, and emotional challenges, and was open to students from all five boroughs of New York City. The school was initially established in the former location of the New York College for Women, and was later relocated to a building on West 68th Street in Manhattan. In 1958, the school was merged into the New York City Public Schools system, and its students were integrated into other schools in the city. Today, the buildings that were formerly used by the New York Interschool are now home to other public schools in Manhattan.\n",

            "original summary: In English-speaking culture, a milkman joke is a class of joke exploiting fear of adultery and mistaken paternity. This class of jokes has its roots in the early part of the 20th century, prior to the regular availability of milk in supermarkets. At that time, milk in glass bottles was delivered directly to customers' houses by milkmen, generally in the morning (at which time empty bottles were also collected). Men were commonly the main financial supporters of their families, and a man's wife tended to remain at home to care for their children and home. As the milkman would visit the home at a time when the husband would be away at work, this created an opportune situation for adultery. Similar jokes referring to other professions, such as postmen, plumbers, pizza delivery drivers, and swimming pool cleaners, are also known. Oftentimes, a different profession will replace the milkman in various jokes. For instance, in Spain, 'milkman' jokes are told about butaneros: persons who deliver butane, bottled fuel gas. \n",

It typically involves a person posing as a milkman, who delivers milk to a person's doorstep and then asks for a specific item, such as a specific brand of toilet paper, a specific type of cheese, or a specific type of underwear. The recipient then responds by asking for a specific item, such as a specific type of tire, a specific type of car, or a specific type of lightbulb. The joke is often played for comedic effect, and has been used to express frustration, annoyance, or to make a point about the absurdity of certain situations. The meme has been widely spread through social media and has been used to convey a variety of messages.\n",

            "original summary: The Sterilization League of New Jersey (SLNJ) organization was founded in 1937 by Marion Stephenson Olden (1888–1989), a eugenics-minded social worker and wife of Princeton professor Paul R. Coleman-Norton (Dowbiggin, 2008, p. 36), with the purpose \"to aid in the preparation, promotion, enactment and enforcement of legislative measures designed to provide for the improvement of the human stock by the selective sterilization of the mentally defective and of those afflicted with inherited or inheritable physical disease.” Encouraged by the eugenic sterilization legislation enacted by the state of Georgia in 1937, the SLNJ lobbied intensely, although unsuccessfully, between 1939 and 1942 for the passage of a state sterilization law in New Jersey and conducted an educational program of publications and exhibits designed to promote sterilization. In 1943, the League was renamed Sterilization League For Human Betterment and began to expand its activities nationwide. After objections from relatives of Ezra Gosney, founder of the Human Betterment Foundation, the organization formally incorporated and changed its name again to Birthright, Inc.: a national, nonprofit, educational organization with the aim of promoting \"all reliable and scientific means for improving the biological stock of the human race.” When the Human Betterment Foundation was dissolved in 1943, its promotional activities for eugenic sterilization were continued through Birthright, which received most of the Foundation's records regarding its work on sterilization programs and also the (financial) support of such past Foundation-backers as C.M. Goethe, Paul Popenoe, and Lois Gosney Castle, who had succeeded her father in 1942 as head of the Foundation. The Manhattan studio at the New York Academy of Medicine of Robert Latou Dickinson, who had been a member since 1943 and became the first chairman of the organization's medical and scientific committee in 1949, served as new headquarters in 1950. That same year, Birthright was renamed the Human Betterment Association of America (HBAA). \n",

The League gained momentum in the 1920s and 1930s, with the support of prominent individuals such as eugenicist Madison Grant and the cooperation of the New Jersey state government. Throughout this period, the League lobbied for and supported the implementation of sterilization programs, which were carried out in New Jersey and other states. During World War II, the League was disbanded, and its efforts were largely overshadowed by the larger issues of the war. However, after the war, the League's ideas continued to influence the eugenics movement and the development of sterilization policies in the United States. Today, the legacy of the Sterilization League of New Jersey remains controversial, with some historians and scholars arguing that its actions were a form of genocide, while others defend its efforts as a necessary response to social and economic issues of the time. The organization was dissolved in 1947, but the legacy\n",

            "original summary: The black saddlebags (Tramea lacerata) is a species of skimmer dragonfly found throughout North America. It has distinctive wings with characteristic black blotches at their proximal ends, which make the dragonfly look as though it is wearing saddlebags. The black saddlebags is a relatively large dragonfly at about 5 centimeters in length. The body is thin and black, and the female may have lighter spotting or mottling dorsally. The head is much wider than the rest of the body and is dark brown in color. The insect can be found in at bodies of stagnant water, such as ponds and ditches. The female mates once and stores all the sperm she needs for fertilization. If she should mate again, the second male will remove the sperm of the first male from her body with the brush-like apparatus on his specially-adapted penis. The larvae of the dragonflies hatch and eat anything they can catch, favoring a carnivorous diet of organisms smaller than themselves. Adults of the species, especially males, congregate in swarms. Some populations of this dragonfly undertake migrations. Both the larvae and adult forms are efficient predators of mosquitoes, so they are a helpful insect to have in wet areas where mosquito infestations occur. \n",
